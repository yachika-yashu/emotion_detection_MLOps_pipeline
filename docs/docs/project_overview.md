# Project Overview

The project began as a single Jupyter notebook used for experimentation. Once the modeling approach was validated, the notebook was refactored into a production-style pipeline composed of independent Python modules.

## Key ideas demonstrated:

- Separation of concerns

- Script-based execution instead of notebooks

- Deterministic, repeatable pipelines using DVC

- Parameter-driven experimentation

## Tools used:

- Python

- DVC

- Git & GitHub

- Cookiecutter Data Science
