# Why This Project Matters

Many ML projects stop at model training. This project focuses on engineering maturity:

- Reproducible experiments

- Traceable data and models

- Clear separation between experimentation and production code

- Pipeline automation

The result is not just a trained model, but a reliable ML system.
